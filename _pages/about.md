Hi, I am Vera Neplenbroek, and I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, where I am part of the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/). My PhD on Safety in Conversational AI is part of the [LESSEN project](https://lessen-project.nl/), and I am supervised by [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/) and [Arianna Bisazza](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/).
